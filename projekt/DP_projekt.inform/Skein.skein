    <result xml:space="preserve">The living room of the Victorian mansion buzzed with chatter, the clinking of glasses, and the enchanting voice of a singer filling the air. After all, a New Year's Eve party like this was a rare occasion.&#x000A;&#x000A;When the clock struck midnight, fireworks illuminated the sky outside, and the guests erupted into cheers of "Happy New Year!" The sound of toasts and laughter echoed throughout the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;Moments later, the lights flickered back on, and an eerie silence replaced the joyful music. Gasps and murmurs spread as all eyes fell on the lifeless body of Simon the chipmunk sprawled on the carpet, blood pooling around him.&#x000A;&#x000A;Duck-tective burst dramatically into the room, his detective hat slightly askew. You followed close behind.&#x000A;&#x000A;"It appears," he quacked with flair, "we have a MURDER on our hands!"&#x000A;&#x000A;He pointed a feathery wing at the scene. "Apprentice! This is your moment. Search the mansion, gather evidence, interrogate the suspects, and do whatever it takes to crack this case. This is your final test to earn your badge as a true detective!"&#x000A;&#x000A;With a sly grin, Duck-tective added, "Of course, I already know who the culprit is. If you find yourself lost, you may consult me... but only if you wish me to question your capabilities. Now go forth and question the suspects-quack, quack!"&#x000A;&#x000A;**INFORMATION FOR THE PLAYER**&#x000A;&#x000A;You can guess the murderer when you find all the clues. If you know to which character the clue is tied to, you can ask that character about it. For neutral clues like keys and chests, ask Duck-tective for help.&#x000A;&#x000A;Try looking inside or behind the items you see in every room.&#x000A;&#x000A;If you want to try guessing the killer before finding all the clues type "guess (suspect)" - this will, however, end the game</result>

But Dios m&#x00ED;o, I never expected this! We used to be close, working together a lot, but not so much lately. Simon and I even did a collab on a song once, back when he was still part of a group.

Tiny, ornate furniture is arranged with meticulous precision, from a walnut-shell bed lined with silk to a thimble-sized lamp on the nightstand. The air is sweet with the faint scent of acorns, and an open chest in the corner overflows with shiny trinkets and treasures. Despite its charm, a few scattered papers on the floor and a knocked-over stool suggest that not everything was as perfectly in place as it seemed.&#x000A;&#x000A;From here you can only go south to the Small Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a bed and a mirror here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Duck-tective steps forward, his beak sharp as he recounts the story.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Shakira met Simon years ago when he was just a young chipmunk. She saw his potential and watched as he skyrocketed to fame with his boy band, "Alvin and the Chipmunks." She even worked with him on a song once, proud of how far he had come. But that pride quickly turned to anger. Shakira soon discovered that Simon had been stealing songs from artists, including her. He'd change them just enough to avoid lawsuits, then claim them as his own. That was enough to make Shakira see red."&#x000A;&#x000A;"On New Year's Eve, Simon invited her to perform, promising her payment for her time. But that wasn't why Shakira was there. She had come to confront him, to search his house for proof of the thievery. And when she found it-Simon's own computer messages-Shakira was beyond furious. Her own manager, the very person who had helped her rise to fame, had been working behind her back with Simon.&#x000A;&#x000A;The rage inside her built, and during her performance, Shakira put her plan into action. She used Simon's remote to turn off the lights in the room, cloaking her movements in darkness. Then, in a swift and final act, she stepped on Simon with her heel. Just as his "step on me" poster suggested, it only took a second, and no one noticed the tiny body."&#x000A;&#x000A;Duck-tective raises an eyebrow. "What do you think apprentice? Was it worth it?

Our family carries a terrible curse. It has haunted our bloodline for generations, striking down many of your ancestors, as it did your brothers. I fear it may be coming for you as well. I beg you to be vigilant, Simon. Guard yourself from harm, and trust no one too easily.&#x000A;&#x000A;But know this: though the bloodline may be cursed, family is more than blood. You have a half-cousin, Mario, who is tied to our legacy but spared from the curse. He is not of the direct bloodline, but he is family nonetheless. It is my deepest hope that you open your heart to him. His mother Rosie and I were very close in our youth.&#x000A;&#x000A;If, God forbid, the curse claims you as well, it is my wish that Mario takes over our estate, our property, and everything that was meant to be yours. He is the only one I trust to honor our family's name and ensure its legacy survives beyond this curse.&#x000A;&#x000A;Simon, you are stronger than you know. But remember, strength alone cannot undo the forces that conspire against us. Be careful, my son. My love and my hopes will remain with you, always.&#x000A;&#x000A;With all my love, Your Father&#x000A;&#x000A;Wow... a curse? Half-cousin? Who could have predicted this one?

Armed with a wooden bat, he arrived at Simon's house, ready to wreak havoc. He started by smashing a statue in the garden when Simon opened the door. Realizing the trouble he was in, Simon invited Shrek to the party, trying to calm him down. Shrek, though furious, eased up a little after a few Krabby Patties."&#x000A;&#x000A;"But things took a turn when Shrek snooped around Simon's house and found a document confirming the project was already set in motion, claiming minimal environmental impact. Enraged by the deceit, Shrek couldn't hold back. At the party, in front of everyone, he stomped down hard on Simon, crushing him completely. No one even noticed as his tiny body was crushed underfoot." "Shrek just stood there, panting. His face twisted in frustration. "I couldn't let him get away with it. He was ruin" everything... ma family... ma swamp," Shrek muttered to himself, rubbin" his brow. "But now... now it's safe. Too bad it had to end like this."&#x000A;&#x000A;Duck-tective lets out a long sigh.
